# Astronomical-image-denoiser (AID)
> Astronomical image denoiser is a GAN model that can be used to denoise the noisy astronomical images obtained from space telescopes.

# Need for AID ðŸ’¡ :
Everyday,thousands of space image data has been collected through years. Even though we have highly efficient devices such as Hubble and  to capture the space, as the outer space filled with lot of anonymous particles and due to some device malfunctions, we will not be able to get the clear images of the astronomical objects always. Images are always found with some noise and anomalies.
